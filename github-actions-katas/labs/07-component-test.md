## Component test

After running `unit test` in exercise 2, now the time came to run `component test`, that requires your docker username and password as env, and a `ci/component-test.sh` script that runs a docker-compose file with component tests.

# Tasks

1. Add job named `Component-test`, which will run `ci/component-test.sh` script that runs a docker-compose file with component tests.
2. This job needs to be dependent on `Docker-image` job.
3. Similarly as in previous exercise `06-docker-image.md` it requires docker username and password.

If you added the job succesfully, your pipeline should look like:
